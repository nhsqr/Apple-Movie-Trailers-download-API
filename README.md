# Apple Movie Trailers download API
Download Apple movie trailers directly from command line (BASH)

This is a very simple script for downloading movie trailers from Apple servers

It is created by reverse engineering the Apple web page API

It doesn't have much error checking but that should not be a problem

The script needs 'wget' compiled with ssl support and 'jq' package installed on the system

The usage is very simple:

    apple.sh "Movie you want to search"
